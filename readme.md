# Enhanced Config

This repository demonstrates the usage of an enhanced configuration in an application, using [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) as an example. The key elements to focus on are the "Get Changed Files" and "Lint JS with Enhanced Rules" steps in the [CI GitHub Action](./.github/workflows/ci.yml), as well as the [eslint.enhanced.config.js](./eslint.enhanced.config.js) file.
